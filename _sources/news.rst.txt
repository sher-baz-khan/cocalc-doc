2020-01-16: dark mode
=====================================================

Added: an option to enable overall dark mode in "Account" /  "Preferences".
Checking this gives you a uniformly dark background across the whole page:

2020-01-16: nbgrader autograder for Jupyter notebooks
=====================================================

CoCalc now has integrated nbgrader/autograder for Jupyter notebooks. You can create an assignment with problems that are automatically graded, providing immediate feedback to students. Manual grades and instructor comments can be added after the assignment is collected.

It's all tightly integrated with the course management system. You don't have to configure anything -- you can just use it...

There's an extensive getting-started guide here: :doc:`nbgrader in CoCalc <teaching-nbgrader>`.

2020-01-13: Export student file use
=====================================

This feature  provides 1-click export of extensive data about what students do in an assignment or handout. Getting information about what happens with anonymous users of shares is not implemented.

To get a report about all the times when students opened or edited any file in an assignment or handout, do the following:

#. Open a .course file.
#. Toggle to show the information about a handout or assignment, and scroll to the bottom.
#. There is a new button "Export file use times for this..."
#. Click that button.
#. A json file will open in a new tab. Hopefully the format is self explanatory. The times are all in milliseconds since the epoch, so in Javascript you can write new Date(time) to make this a date, and in Python do `this <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3694487/in-python-how-do-you-convert-seconds-since-epoch-to-a-datetime-object>`_. You can also load json into python using the json module (import json).

The json files are created in the following path::

    course-exports/[name of course]/file-use-times/[handouts|assignments]/assignment_name.json

2020-01-13: Site licenses
===============================

Site license for courses
-------------------------

Site licenses can be used to upgrade student projects in a CoCalc-managed course.
Enter the license key in course configuration as shown below.
After that, all student projects associated to that course are automatically upgraded the next time they start. If this is something you might be interested in, contact us at `help@cocalc.com <mailto:help@cocalc.com">`_.

     Enter license key in course file Configuration tab.

Site license for individual projects
------------------------------------

A site license can be used for a project that is not part of a CoCalc course. Open project settings. Scroll down under "Project usage and quotas" and click the button marked "Upgrade using a license key...". Enter your license key in the box that opens and click Save. Upgrades provided by the license will be applied.

2019-12-16: Anonymous accounts
===============================

New users do not have to sign up on CoCalc any more.
An "anonymous" account is created and you can start exporing CoCalc immediately.
It is possible to convert this account into a regular CoCalc account any time.

Beyond that, :ref:`publicly shared files <sharing-files>` can be the seed for a new project.
This makes it easy to experiment with published content.
